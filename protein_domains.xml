**What it does**

This tool utilizes LAST to find hits of given sequence which is at first translated to protein sequence and then compared to our database of protein domains and subsequently annotated. Frameshifts in the sequence and strand orientation are taken into consideration when finding and reporting hits.
As the result the domains with the highest confidention score at a certain region are reported and classified according to the type and lineage of repetition they come from. In case of ambiguous hits, the element annotation is leveled-up in order to obtain conclusive classifictaion.
