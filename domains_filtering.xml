**WHAT IT DOES**

This tool runs filtering on either primary GFF3 file of all domains, i.e. output of *Protein Domains Finder* tool or already filtered GFF3 file. Domains can be filtered based on:

**Quality of alignment such as**:
	- alignment sequence identity
	- alignment similarity
	- alignment proportion length
	- number of interruptions (frameshifts or stop codons) per 100 AA
		
**Protein domain type**
	This filtration is based on "Name" attribute of GFF3 file
	
**Repetitive element classification**
	In the text field you can specify a classification string you wish to filter. This filtration is based on "Final_Classification" attribute of GFF file, so it must be in the proper form (classification levels are separated by "|"). You can see which classifications occurs in your data taking a look into Classification summary table output. If you leave the field blank, domains of all classifications will be reported
	
All the records containing ambiguous domain type (e.g. RH/INT) are filtered out automatically. They do not take place in filtered gff file neither the protein sequence is derived from these potentially chimeric domains. Optimal results (for general usage) should be reached using the default quality filtering parameters which are appropriate to find all types of protein domains. Keep in mind that the results should be critically assessed based on your input data anyhow.

**!NOTE**: If you are working with non-Viridiplantae eukayrotic organisms, the results might not be optimal as the domains database is mostly based on Viridiplantae organisms. In this case filtering parameters should be adjusted and results more carefully inspected.
Based on the testing we recommend to set up these parameters for non-Viridiplantae eukayrotics:

- Minimum identity: 0,3
- Minimum similarity: 0,4
- Minimum alignmnet length: 0,8
- Interruption: 3

**OUTPUTS PRODUCED:**
	1.	Filtered GFF3 file
	2.	Translated protein sequences of the filtered domains regions of original DNA sequence in fasta format
	
		*Translated sequences are taken from the best alignment (Best_Hit attribute) within a domain region, however this alignment does not necessarily have to cover the whole region reported as a domain in gff file*		
		
	3.	Table containing all domains repetive elements classifications of any level reported for both input and filtered GFF file
